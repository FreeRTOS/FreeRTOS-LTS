## Overview
FreeRTOS offers feature stability with long term support (LTS) releases. FreeRTOS LTS libraries come with security updates and critical bug fixes to the FreeRTOS kernel and IoT libraries listed below for two years, and are maintained by AWS for the benefit of the FreeRTOS community. With FreeRTOS LTS, you get a complete set of libraries needed to build secure connected IoT and embedded products. Long term support helps reduce maintenance and testing costs associated with updating libraries on your devices already in production.

AWS also offers FreeRTOS Extended Maintenance Plan (EMP) that provides you with security patches and critical bug fixes on your chosen FreeRTOS LTS version for up to an additional 10 years. With FreeRTOS EMP, your FreeRTOS-based long-lived devices can rely on a version that has feature stability and receives security updates for years. You receive timely notification of upcoming patches on FreeRTOS libraries, so you can plan the deployment of security patches on your IoT devices. To learn more about FreeRTOS EMP, see the [FreeRTOS Features page](https://aws.amazon.com/freertos/features/).

## Upgrading to FreeRTOS 202406-LTS from a previous version of FreeRTOS LTS

FreeRTOS 202406 LTS libraries are backward compatible with 202210.xx LTS, except
AWS IoT OTA and FreeRTOS-Plus-TCP libraries. AWS IoT OTA library is not included in the LTS 202406 release.
Instead, AWS IoT MQTT File Streams are included in this release, and we suggest user
reference to [Modular Over the Air Updates](https://freertos.org/freertos-core/over-the-air-updates/index.html),
which makes use of the AWS IoT MQTT File Streams library for OTA application design.
For FreeRTOS-Plus-TCP, refer to [these instructions](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Plus-TCP/blob/main/GettingStarted.md)
on how to update your projects to use the new version.


## FreeRTOS LTS Versioning and Patches

FreeRTOS LTS releases use a date-based versioning scheme (YYYYMM) followed by a patch sequential number (.XX).
For example, FreeRTOS 202406.01 LTS means the first patch to the June-2024 FreeRTOS LTS release.
You can review the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md) and subscribe to [GitHub notifications](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/about-notifications) to receive information on patches or other updates to this repository.
