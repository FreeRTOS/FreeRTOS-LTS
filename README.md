## Overview
FreeRTOS offers feature stability with long term support (LTS) releases. FreeRTOS LTS libraries come with security updates and critical bug fixes to the FreeRTOS kernel and IoT libraries listed below for two years, and are maintained by AWS for the benefit of the FreeRTOS community. With FreeRTOS LTS, you get a complete set of libraries needed for secure cloud connectivity. Long term support helps reduce maintenance and testing costs associated with updating libraries on your devices already in production.
